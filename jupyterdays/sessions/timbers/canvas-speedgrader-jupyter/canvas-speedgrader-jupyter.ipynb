    "Now that you have learned how to create and share teaching materials using GitHub & JupyterHub ([https://ubc.syzygy.ca/](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/)), this session will demonstrate how you use Canvas and its speedgrader functionality to perform manual grading. This is probably the easiest and most straight-forward way to get started grading Jupyter assignments, but not the most efficient. Patrick Walls will talk about autograding Jupyter assignments using a tool called [`nbgrader`](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is more efficient but a little more complex to setup and use.

    "\n",
    "Manually grading Jupyter assignments in Canvas using the speedgrader is pretty straightforward to set up, however there are a few small things to be aware of to make this run smoothly. First is the file type the students submit. When working on their assignments in Jupyter, the students will be working with an `.ipynb` file. These files are great that they are executable and can run Python or R code, for example. However, they only render nicely in Jupyter (and on GitHub too). Such files look like this in a plain text editor (and do not render at all on Canvas):\n",

    " Thus, it is highly recommened to get the students to submit a more Canvas friendly file format for grading Jupyter assignments. Probably the lightest weight, and most true to render (i.e., in respect to what the `.ipynb` file looks like on Jupyter) filetype is an `.html` file. Happily, `.html` files are viewable in Canvas! `.pdf` also works, but in practice we find that sometimes errors in markdown or LaTeX can lead to annoying error in the rendering to `.pdf` process that are difficult to debug and demotivating for students. \n",
