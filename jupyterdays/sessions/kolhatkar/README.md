## Teaching Computational Linguistics with Jupyter

Most of us use services such as voice assistants (e.g., Siri or Alexa), smart compose (e.g., Gmail sentence completition), machine translation (e.g., Google translate) in our everyday life. A common component which is used in all these services is **language models**.    

In this short talk, I will give you an overview of language models. While doing it, I'll demonstrate how I use Jupyter notebooks to teach with different modalities in my classroom.
