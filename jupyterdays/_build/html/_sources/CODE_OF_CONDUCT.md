# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
For Jupyterdays, we are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. 
All participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Jupyterdays activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. 
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Jupyterdays including, but not limited to, class meetings, email communication, and online forums such as Slack and GitHub. The Jupyterdays organizing team are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

The Jupyterdays organizing team are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed by the Jupyterdays organizing team and will be kept confidential.

## The Jupyterdays Code of Conduct
For Jupyterdays, we are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our speakers or participants or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in the Jupyterdays activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by Jupyterdays including, but not limited to, class meetings, email communication, and online forums such as Slack and GitHub. The Jupyterdays organizing team are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. 

### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of 
platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all 
Jupyterdays events and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any Jupyterdays event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Jupyterdays events and platforms, either 
online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the teaching team may warn the offender and or engage the Jupyterdays 
organizing team to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

## Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a Jupyterdays event or in an online space outside of organised events, we ask that you report it to the Jupyterdays 
organizing team. The current Jupyterdays organizing team is Patrick Walls, Warren Code and Tiffany Timbers. An email to tiffany.timbers@stat.ubc.ca will be seen by
Tiffany Timbers. To report a Jupyterdays code of conduct violation that will not be seen by Tiffany Timbers, an alternative contact person is Warren Code. His email is warcode@science.ubc.ca.
